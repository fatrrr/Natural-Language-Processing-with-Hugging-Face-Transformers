This Guided Project will walk you through some of the applications of Hugging Face Transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Hugging Face Transformers package is very popular and versatile Python library that provides pre-trained models for a variety of applications in NLP, as well other areas such as image analysis, audio analysis, multimodal analysis (optical character recognition, video classification, visual question answering and many more).

This Guided Project will focus on text analysis tasks, which are:

Text Classification.
Sentiment Analysis. Classifies the polarity of a given text.
Topic Classification. Classifies sequences into specified class names.
Text Generator. Generates text from a given input.
Token Classification.
Name Entity Recognition (NER). Labels each word with the entity it represents.
Question answering. Extracts the answer from the context.
Text Summarization. Generates a summary of a long sequence of text or document.
Translation. Translates text into another language.
